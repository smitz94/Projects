# ENERGY TRANSFER IN 2D FLUID TURBULENCE

## PROBLEM STATEMENT :

Compute Energy spectrum and flux using numerical simulation and verify the validity of turbulence model.

## PROJECT DETAILS :

**Turbulence model** â€“ energy exchange among various fourier modes.


**Simulating Platform** - TARANG developed by Prof. M.K Verma and team. **_SHAHEEN II_** was used to deploy simulations.


**Base theory- Kolmogorov theory(universal theory)** - for 2-D turbulence we observe constant inverse energy cascade for low wave numbers 
and constant enstrophy cascade for large wave numbers. To learn more visit 
[_KOLMOGOROV's THEORY_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turbulence).

## ANALYSIS :

* Started simulation with 64*64 grid size.

* For each grid calculating Reynolds number to make sure the flow which we are analyzing is turbulent.

* Plotted energy spectrum for each grid size and verify the base case for forced wavenumber.

* Refined the grid size upto 1024*1024.
