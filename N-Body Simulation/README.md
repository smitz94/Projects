> ### BARNES-HUT ALGORITHM (QUAD TREE STRUCTURE FOR 2D PROBLEM)

In a Two-dimensional n-body simulation, the Barnesâ€“Hut algorithm recursively divides the n bodies into groups by storing them in an quad-tree. 
Each node in this tree represents a region of the two-dimensional space. 
The topmost node represents the whole space, and its four children represent the four octants of the space. 
The space is recursively subdivided into quadrants until each subdivision contains 0 or 1 bodies (some regions do not have bodies in all of their quadrants). 
There are two types of nodes in the quad-tree: internal and external nodes. An external node has no children and is either empty or represents a single body. 
Each internal node represents the group of bodies beneath it, and stores the center of mass and the total mass of all its children bodies.

### CODE EXPLATION
* [BODY.JAVA](https://github.com/smitz94/Projects/blob/master/N-Body%20Simulation/Body.java): 

This file contains Class Body that is going to store and create the basic structure of bodies in the space. Further it calculates basic physical quantities such as gravitational force between two bodies, distance between them and velocity changes.

* [QUAD.JAVA](https://github.com/smitz94/Projects/blob/master/N-Body%20Simulation/Quad.java)

This file contains Class Quad which is going to create four quadrants in two-dimensional space.

* [BHTREE.JAVA](https://github.com/smitz94/Projects/blob/master/N-Body%20Simulation/BHTree.java)

This file contains Class BHtree which is going to create the tree structure. This Class is going to implement the **Barnes-Hut Algorithm**.

* [NBodyBH.JAVA](https://github.com/smitz94/Projects/blob/master/N-Body%20Simulation/NBodyBH.java)

This file contains the main method that will invoke the simulation and it will take input from the console and draw the n-body interation in output stream.

### HOW TO RUN CODE: 

```bash
Run the terminal or command prompt as administrator
move to the directory where all these files are present. After that copy the following sytaxt in terminal:

java NBody.java -Xlint
javac NBody < Inputs/(filename from Inputs folder).txt
```
