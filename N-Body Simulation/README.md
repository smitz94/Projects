> ### BARNES-HUT ALGORITHM (QUAD TREE STRUCTURE FOR 2D PROBLEM)

In a Two-dimensional n-body simulation, the Barnesâ€“Hut algorithm recursively divides the n bodies into groups by storing them in an quad-tree. 
Each node in this tree represents a region of the two-dimensional space. 
The topmost node represents the whole space, and its four children represent the four octants of the space. 
The space is recursively subdivided into quadrants until each subdivision contains 0 or 1 bodies (some regions do not have bodies in all of their quadrants). 
There are two types of nodes in the quad-tree: internal and external nodes. An external node has no children and is either empty or represents a single body. 
Each internal node represents the group of bodies beneath it, and stores the center of mass and the total mass of all its children bodies.
